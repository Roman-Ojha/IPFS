*) What is IPFS?
    -> IPFS(InterPlanetary File System) is a peer to peer, decentralized and distributed filesystem.
    -> NOTE: this is not blockchain but a filesystem
    -> IPFS uses DHT(distributed has table) and Merkle DAG(directed acyclic graph) data structure
    -> It uses a protocol similar to BitTorrent to decide how to move data around the network
    -> It uses content Addressing rather than Location Addressing

*) Location Addressing
    -> Location Addressing work on location based

*) Content Addressing
    -> on Content Addressing it will provide the hashing value of that content
    -> This has 64 hexadecimal characters. Each character is of 4 bits.
    -> So in total it has 64*4 bit i.e 256 bits
